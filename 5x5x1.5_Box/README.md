## 5x5x1.5_Box
I made this for storing some endmills in.  The dimensions are the internal size, with 0.2" walls.  
I printed this using the standard PETG settings in Prusa slicer, and it did thermally deform 
significantly.  I haven't had a chance to try other settings, but it is a large object, and was printed 
with the printer in a fairly cold room.  Your milage may vary.
