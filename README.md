## 3d Designs

I seem to be running into bugs on my Thingiverse account, and some of these designs
won't be for 3d printing anyway, so i've decided to start storing them here.  Mostly
this will be STL files, but I am going to try to also remember to export STEP
files incase anyone wants to mess with them.

If you see anything you want and need it in a different format, feel free to
reach out.

I design in Fusion 360 and Blender.  Less so in Blender though, since I am better
with CAD than free-form.
